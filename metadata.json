    " This module helps users that want to train a deep learning visual identification algorithm (Yolov8) with citizen science data. It was developed with the intent to clean and train automatically on Deep Sea Spy data (citizen science project).\n",
    " The cleaning is in 2 steps : \n",
    " - converting the bounding boxes in a regular format (optional). In Deep Sea Spy, they come in 3 different formats (points, lines and polygons)\n",
    " - unify bounding boxes, using the redundancy of the information as a confirmation for the presence of an individual.\n",
    " There also are other data manipulation/visualisation tools provided in this module to help scientists with the data analysis.\n",
    " The user can :\n",
    " - Clean its own dataset using either the Deepas API, the Notebook.ipynb or the pipeline_txt.py file.\n",
    " - Train with its own data from nextcloud (training is automatic in pipeline_txt.py)\n",
    " - Use the existing model traind on Deep Sea Spy data (see zenodo : ) for inference.\n",
    " Further information in the README.me file provided within this repository.\n",
    " This module is mainly based on this already existing module : https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-yolov8-torch\n",
    " You can find more information on Yolov8 here :\n",
