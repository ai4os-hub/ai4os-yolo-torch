# YOLO training hyperparameters
# Those are the main Yolo hyperparameters you might want to tweak depending on your available resources
# They strongly impact the performance of your model and the time it takes to complete it's training

# YOLO complementary hyperparameters
# Those parameters also impact the training of your model, but it depends on the type/quality of images you are feeding the model.
# If you don't understand what they are doing, it is strongly recommendend to stay with this default configuration.
# Doc : https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#train-settings
# You can train your model to find it's best suited hyperparameters on it's own : https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/hyperparameter-tuning/
